<h3> Experience </h3>
<b>3D Semantic Reconstruction from a Monocular Camera with a Novel Multi-task Network May 2018 - September 2018 </b><br>
We explore the interplay between low-level features for both depth and semantic prediction.<br> 
The proposed network can produce the depth and semantic maps simultaneously, which provides basic knowledge for further semantic map reconstruction.<br>
We apply image segmentation techniques to refine the depth prediction to reduce the fluctuations caused by convolution layers.<br> 
The final map is saved in a memory-friendly way to present a large-scale urban scene.<br>
The corresponding paper is recently submitted to the IEEE ICRA 2019. A video demo is uploaded to <a href="https://youtu.be/iSrZSrdn8zks">YouTube</a> for demonstrating the result of our algorithm.<br>
<br>
<b>Using 3D Map Completion Method to Solve Ghosting Phenomenon</b><div class="date">October 2017 - Now</div><br>
The proposed method solves ghosting phenomenon caused by moving objects in a stereo-based 3D map.<br>
The color and depth completion approach fills large area loss employing the planarity knowledge to propagate the structure.<br>
The corresponding paper is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics.<br>
<br>

<b>Planecell 3D Map Representation Method Developing</b> <div class="date">January 2017 - September 2017</div><br>
The plancell extracts planarity from the depth-assisted image segmentation and then directly projects these depth planes into the 3D world.<br>
The method demonstrates its advancement especially dealing with the large-scale structural environment, such as autonomous driving scene.<br>
Intend to obtain instance-level segmentation result from semantic segmentation.<br>

<b>Moving-object Detection Algorithm Developing </b> <div class="date">March 2016 - January 2017</div><br>
The proposed method abandons the process of dense optical/scene flow calculation while giving pixel-level moving-object detection results. By accelerating on the GPU, it can run at 20 frames per second.<br>
A video demo is uploaded to <a href="https://youtu.be/DUGcoNMu0S8">YouTube</a> for demonstrating the result of our algorithm.<br>
