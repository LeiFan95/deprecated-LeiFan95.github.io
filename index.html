<h3> Experience </h3>
CNN-SPS Algorithm Developing	September 2015 <br>
The proposed method applies semi-global matching and slanted-plane model on the similarities from CNN to produce accurate dense disparity maps.<br>
The proposed method achieves the eighth place on the KITTI stereo 2015 benchmark.<br>
<br>
High accuracy reconstruction of outdoor and indoor scenes  September 2015 - May 2016<br>
The proposed method uses indoor platforms and outdoor platforms to collect stereo data, and then reconstructs both pixel-based and grid-based 3D maps.<br>
This work is under the Special Funds for the Cultivation of Guangdong College Students' Scientic and
Technological Innovation.<br>
<br>
Moving-object Detection Algorithm Developing March 2016 - January 2017 <br>
The proposed method abandons the process of dense optical/scene flow calculation while giving pixel-level moving-object detection results. By accelerating on the GPU, it can run at 20 frames per second.<br>
The corresponding paper is under the revision of the transaction of Intelligent Transportation Systems.<br>
A video demo is uploaded to https://youtu.be/DUGcoNMu0S8 for demonstrating the result of our algorithm.<br>
<br>
DJI, Inc Summer 2016<br>
Visual Engineer Intern Shenzhen, P.R. China<br>
Developing 3D reconstruction and obstacle avoidance algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicle based on the stereo camera.<br>
Calibration and rectification of stereo fish-eye camera.<br>
